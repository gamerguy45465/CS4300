Performance Measure: To Reduce the amount of steps needed to reach the goal. This would require performing different search operations (such as the A* Heiristics Search) to ensure that we are getting the best optimal path as possible.

Environment: Environment includes a 3x3 grid, Tiles that are numbered 1-8 that also includes an empty slot, and the movement of such tiles that are near an empty slot.

Actuators: If a tile is right to be moved, and if it is next to an empty slot, then move that Tile Up, Down, Left or Right. 

Sensors: Sensors to measure if a tile is sitting North, West, South, or East of the empty slot, in which case the tiles can be freely moved. Also, the entire board position must be taken into account by the agent. This would require sensors to sense which numbers are in which position (like if the first tile is in position 3, etc). Lastly, would require a sensor to know if a tile is right to be moved or not.
