Variables:
X11 = Bottom Left

X44 = Top Right


Domains:

Every Variable should initially contain the same domain:

D(Xij) = {1, 2, 3, 4} <---- for a 4x4
D(Xij) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} <---- for a 9x9


However, as the board changes, the domain will change as well to include less and less. I will not be describing all of the possibilities here, since it would take to long to list, and would take up too much space.



Constraints:

-Each variable on each row must all be different (two one's cannot be contained in the same row)
-Each variable on each column must also be different (two one's cannot be contained in the same column)
